		<h3 id="support">Student Travel Support</h3>
		<p align="justify"> As in previous years, ALTA will provide student travel support to attend and present at the workshop in Dunedin, New Zealand. The number of scholarships available, and their value, are still to be determined. These awards can be used to reimburse some of the travel and accommodation expenses. The organising committee reserves the right to make awards as they see fit, or to alter the amount of any awards. </p>
		<p align="justify"> Selected students for the awards will be contacted by the organising committee by mid November 2018. Preference will be given to students who will be presenting a paper at the workshop. </p>
